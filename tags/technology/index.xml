      <description>[]https://content.pivotal.io/blog/automated-machine-learning-deploying-automl-to-the-cloud)
What exactly is AutoML? AutoML is a broad term and technically could encompass the entire data science cycle from data exploration to model building. However, I have found it most commonly refers to automating feature preprocessing and selection, model algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuningâ€“steps located at the end of the data science process.
 AutoML offers tangible benefits for model selection and optimization.  2.It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get started.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I provide an overview of a Python skeleton application I made. This skeleton can help you bridge the gap between your model and a machine learning application.
For example, you can use your existing Flask application, import it in run_app.py as app, and this will add the production ready features of Gunicorn.

      <description>Introduction
Watson IoT blockchain samples currently fall into three broad categories:
 simple single-asset hello world sample
 simple single-asset sample with numerous additional features
 advanced multi-asset sample with events and additional features
  All of these use a schema to drive the related monitoring UI, which can be used to initiate any transaction or query that is exported for external use via the JSON configuration file.

      <title>An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/</link>

      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/</guid>
      <description>Gradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by far the most common way to optimize neural networks. At the same time, every state-of-the-art Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient descent (e.g. lasagne&amp;rsquo;s, caffe&amp;rsquo;s, and keras&amp;rsquo; documentation). These algorithms, however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by.

      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/reactive-stream-vs-akka-stream/</guid>
      <description>Akka Stream Concepts: Source ~&amp;gt; Flow ~&amp;gt; Sink (code example) Akka Stream is built with the decision to offer APIs that are minimal and consistent-as opposed to easy or intuitive. There is no magic, all the API features are explicit. You have operators to define Source, Sink, Flow, Graph and Operators. You have the operators to handle back-pressure, buffering, transformations, failure recovery, etc. But on my opinion the features that make Akka Stream implementation interesting are: 1.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION
A while ago I worked on a project that used this tech stack
Akka HTTP : (actually we used Spray.IO but it is practically the same thing for the purpose of this article). For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know what Akka HTTP is, it is a simple Akka based framework that is also able to expose a REST interface to communicate with the actor system Cassandra database : Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Predictions 2016: The Mobile Revolution Accelerates&amp;rdquo;, Forrester forecasted that by the end of 2016 more than 25% of companies will consider mobile not as a channel, but as a fully integrated part of their overall strategy. Moreover, the research firm expects customer-focused companies to take personalization to the next level by extracting relevant moments from customer data using intelligent data processing techniques:
&amp;ldquo;To serve customers in context where they already are - not where brands find it convenient to serve them, firms must look to use context both to assemble and deliver experiences dynamically&amp;rdquo;</description>

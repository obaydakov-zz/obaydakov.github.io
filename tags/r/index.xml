      <description>Data scientists inhabit such an ever-changing landscape of languages, packages, and frameworks that it can be easy to succumb to tool fatigue. If this sounds familiar, you may have missed the increasing popularity of Linux containers in the DevOps world, in particular Docker. Michelangelo D&amp;rsquo;Agostino demonstrates Docker&amp;rsquo;s many benefits, from making data science code and environments more portable and shareable to making the transition from development to production more seamless to giving data scientists a common basis for collaborating with software engineers, and explains why Docker deserves a place in every data scientist&amp;rsquo;s toolkit.</description>

      <description>iheatmapr is an R package for building complex, interactive heatmaps using modular building blocks. &amp;ldquo;Complex&amp;rdquo; heatmaps are heatmaps in which subplots along the rows or columns of the main heatmap add more information about each row or column. For example, a one column additional heatmap may indicate what group a particular row or column belongs to. Complex heatmaps may also include multiple side by side heatmaps which show different types of data for the same conditions.</description>

      <description>CatBoost is a state-of-the-art open-source gradient boosting on decision trees library.
Developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, it is the successor of the MatrixNet algorithm that is widely used within the company for ranking tasks, forecasting and making recommendations. It is universal and can be applied across a wide range of areas and to a variety of problems.
Accurate: leads or ties competition on standard benchmarks Robust: reduces the need for extensive hyper-parameter tuning Easy-to-use: offers Python interfaces integrated with scikit, as well as R and command-line interfaces Practical: uses categorical features directly and scalably Extensible: allows specifying custom loss functions</description>

      <title>Credit Risk Prediction</title>

      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/credit-risk-prediction/</guid>
      <description>Credit Risk Scoring is a classic yet still increasingly important operation in banking as banks continue to be increasingly risk careful when lending for mortgages or commercial purposes, in an industry known for fierce competition and the global financial crisis. With an accurate credit risk scoring model a bank is able to predict the likelihood of default on a transaction. This will in turn help evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt, as well as determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits, and even determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue through a variety of products.</description>

      <description>Machine learning is at the core of many recent advances in science and technology. With computers beating professionals in games like Go, many people have started asking if machines would also make for better drivers or even better doctors.
In many applications of machine learning, users are asked to trust a model to help them make decisions. A doctor will certainly not operate on a patient simply because &amp;ldquo;the model said so.</description>

      <description>Introduction to rwml-R The book &amp;ldquo;Real-World Machine Learning&amp;rdquo; by Henrik Brink, Joseph W. Richards, and Mark Fetherolf attempts to prepare the reader for the realities of machine learning. It covers a basic framework for machine-learning projects, then it dives into extended examples that show how that basic framework can be applied in realistic situations. It attempts to provide the &amp;ldquo;hidden wisdom&amp;rdquo; on how to go about implementing products and solutions based on machine learning.</description>

      <title>How to Use t-SNE Effectively</title>
      <link>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/how-to-use-t-sne-effectively/</link>

      <description>A popular method for exploring high-dimensional data is something called t-SNE, introduced by van der Maaten and Hinton in 2008 [1]. The technique has become widespread in the field of machine learning, since it has an almost magical ability to create compelling two-dimensonal &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo; from data with hundreds or even thousands of dimensions.

      <title>Using TensorFlow with R</title>
      <link>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/using-tensorflow-with-r/</link>

      <description>TensorFlowT is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google&amp;rsquo;s Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.</description>

      <description>Introduction

Stacking (sometimes called &amp;ldquo;stacked generalization&amp;rdquo;) involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms.
 First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data
 Then a combiner algorithm, the metalearner, is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs. If an arbitrary metalearning algorithm is used, then stacking can theoretically represent any of the ensemble techniques described in this article, although in practice, a single-layer logistic regression model is often used for metalearning.</description>

      <title>Customer Analytics: Using Deep Learning With Keras To Predict Customer Churn</title>
      <link>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/customer-analytics-using-deep-learning-with-keras-to-predict-customer-churn/</link>

      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/customer-analytics-using-deep-learning-with-keras-to-predict-customer-churn/</guid>
      <description>Customer churn is a problem that all companies need to monitor, especially those that depend on subscription-based revenue streams. The simple fact is that most organizations have data that can be used to target these individuals and to understand the key drivers of churn, and we now have Keras for Deep Learning available in R (Yes, in R!!), which predicted customer churn with 82% accuracy. We’re super excited for this article because we are using the new keras package to produce an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model on the IBM Watson Telco Customer Churn Data Set!</description>

      <description>Fraud can be defined as “the crime of getting money by deceiving people” (Cambridge Dictionary); it is as old as humanity: whenever two parties exchange goods or conduct business, there is the potential for one party scamming the other. With an ever-increasing use of the internet for shopping, banking, filing insurance claims etc., these businesses have become targets of fraud in a whole new dimension. Fraud has become a major problem in e-commerce and a lot of resources are being invested to recognize and prevent it.</description>

      <description>gosiris
gosiris is an actor framework for Go allowing local or remote communications between actors and providing runtime discoverability plus distributed tracing.
The remote communications can be done using either an AMQP broker or Kafka. The runtime discoverability is achieved using an etcd registry and the distributed tracing is based on Zipkin.

      <description>Introduction
Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, which is still maturing and which potential is not fully realized yet. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of records. But what makes it unique is that it’s not a private database, but a public one, i.e. everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of it. And a new record can be added only with a consent of other keepers of the database.</description>

      <description>The Problem
While working on a piece of our anonymous telemetry and analytics system, our goal was to be able to handle a large amount of POST requests from millions of endpoints. The web handler would receive a JSON document that may contain a collection of many payloads that needed to be written to Amazon S3, in order for our map-reduce systems to later operate on this data.

      <description>The easiest way to write mission-critical real-time applications and microservices
Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka&amp;rsquo;s server-side cluster technology.

      <description>What are microservices?
Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
Microservices are not a silver bullet
The microservice architecture is not a silver bullet. It has several drawbacks. Moreover, when using this architecture there are numerous issues that you must address.</description>

      <description>In the first article of this series, I demonstrated the most basic patterns for integrating Akka Actors and the Akka Streams API. In the second article, I began developing an example to show how actors compliment streams, providing fault-tolerance and life-cycle management. In the third article, I extended this example to demonstrate how actors can be used to distribute streaming workloads in an Akka cluster, as well as provide location transparency for streams.</description>

      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/designing-a-microservices-architecture-for-failure/</guid>
      <description>A Microservices architecture makes it possible to isolate failures through well-defined service boundaries. But like in every distributed system, there is a higher chance for network, hardware or application level issues. As a consequence of service dependencies, any component can be temporarily unavailable for their consumers. To minimize the impact of partial outages we need to build fault tolerant services that can gracefully respond to certain types of outages.

      <description>Predictive Maintenance is an increasingly popular strategy associated with Industry 4.0; it uses advanced analytics and machine learning to optimize machine costs and output (see Google Trends plot below).
A common use case for Predictive Maintenance is to proactively monitor machines, so as to predict when a check-up is needed to reduce failure and maximize performance. In contrast to traditional maintenance, where each machine has to undergo regular routine check-ups, Predictive Maintenance can save costs and reduce downtime.</description>

      <description>The term “microservices” describes a new software development style that has grown from recent trends in software development/management practices—practices meant to increase the speed and efficiency of developing and managing software solutions at scale.
Agile methods, DevOps culture, cloud, Linux containers, and the widespread adoption (both culturally and technically) of CI/CD methods across the industry are making it possible to build truly modular largescale service-optimized systems for both internal and commercial use.</description>

      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/ensemble-learning-to-improve-machine-learning-results/</guid>
      <description>Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking).
Ensemble methods can be divided into two groups:
sequential ensemble methods where the base learners are generated sequentially (e.g. AdaBoost).
The basic motivation of sequential methods is to exploit the dependence between the base learners. The overall performance can be boosted by weighing previously mislabeled examples with higher weight.</description>

      <description>Introduction
Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency primitives make it easy to construct streaming data pipelines that make efficient use of I/O and multiple CPUs. This article presents examples of such pipelines, highlights subtleties that arise when operations fail, and introduces techniques for dealing with failures cleanly.
What is a pipeline?
There&amp;rsquo;s no formal definition of a pipeline in Go; it&amp;rsquo;s just one of many kinds of concurrent programs. Informally, a pipeline is a series of stages connected by channels, where each stage is a group of goroutines running the same function.</description>

Hyperledger Composer is a framework to accelerate the development of applications built on top of Hyperledger Fabric
Fabric and Composer are open source collaborative blockchain framework projects that is hosted by The Linux Foundation. The Fabric blockchain framework is built from the ground-up for enterprise level application, it is a permissioned network, meaning read/write access to the shared ledger and participation in the peer-to-peer network is restricted to invited and validated members, such restriction makes way for advantages like scalability and confidential transactions that are a fundamental requirements for most enterprise applications.</description>

You’re here because, like me, you’re psyched about the rise of Cryptocurrencies. And you want to know how Blockchains work—the fundamental technology behind them. But understanding Blockchains isn’t easy—or at least wasn’t for me. I trudged through dense videos, followed porous tutorials, and dealt with the amplified frustration of too few examples.
I like learning by doing. It forces me to deal with the subject matter at a code level, which gets it sticking.</description>

      <description>How are Ethereum, IPFS/Filecoin, and BigchainDB complementary? What about Golem, Polkadot, or Interledger? I often get questions like this. So, I decided to write about how I answer those questions, via a first-principles framing.
The quick answer: there’s no one magic system called “blockchain” that magically does everything. Rather, there are really good building blocks of computing that can be used together to create effective decentralized applications. Ethereum can play a role, BigchainDB can play a role, and many more as well.</description>

      <description>A New Tool For Big Data: Blockchain Technology
The recent surge in blockchain technology was sparked by Bitcoin. Technically, all blockchains are simply databases, but databases with “blue ocean” benefits: decentralized / shared control, immutability / audit trails, and native assets / exchanges.
By modern database standards, traditional blockchains have terrible scalability and don’t even have query languages; nonetheless, the blue ocean benefits were enough to capture the imagination of the globe.</description>

      <description>By default, Hive comes with an embedded derby metastore; which stores the meta data and schema of Hive. However, it allows only one user in embedded mode. So it’s advisable to setup an external metastore. Below will be the architecture with MySQL as Metastore.
HiveServer2 – As you can see for JDBC/ODBC communication Hive has a thrift server – HiveServer2. This service is required to do CRUD (DML/DDL) from a script or program (e.</description>

      <description>[]https://content.pivotal.io/blog/automated-machine-learning-deploying-automl-to-the-cloud)
What exactly is AutoML? AutoML is a broad term and technically could encompass the entire data science cycle from data exploration to model building. However, I have found it most commonly refers to automating feature preprocessing and selection, model algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning–steps located at the end of the data science process.
 AutoML offers tangible benefits for model selection and optimization.  2.It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get started.</description>

Watson IoT blockchain samples currently fall into three broad categories:
 simple single-asset hello world sample
 simple single-asset sample with numerous additional features
 advanced multi-asset sample with events and additional features
  All of these use a schema to drive the related monitoring UI, which can be used to initiate any transaction or query that is exported for external use via the JSON configuration file.

      <description>Gradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by far the most common way to optimize neural networks. At the same time, every state-of-the-art Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient descent (e.g. lasagne&amp;rsquo;s, caffe&amp;rsquo;s, and keras&amp;rsquo; documentation). These algorithms, however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by.

      <description>Almost every machine learning algorithm comes with a large number of settings that we, the machine learning researchers and practitioners, need to specify. These tuning knobs, the so-called hyperparameters, help us control the behavior of machine learning algorithms when optimizing for performance, finding the right balance between bias and variance. Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization is an art in itself, and there are no hard-and-fast rules that guarantee best performance on a given dataset.</description>

If this sounds familiar, you may have missed the increasing popularity of Linux containers in the DevOps world, in particular Docker. Michelangelo D&amp;rsquo;Agostino demonstrates Docker&amp;rsquo;s many benefits, from making data science code and environments more portable and shareable to making the transition from development to production more seamless to giving data scientists a common basis for collaborating with software engineers, and explains why Docker deserves a place in every data scientist&amp;rsquo;s toolkit.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;RandomBot&amp;rsquo; is a program that searches randomly the hyper-parameter space from different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, sampling different hyper-parameter settings via hyper-parameter sweep. It executes pre-defined &amp;lsquo;mlr&amp;rsquo; [1] learners over OpenML [2] classification problems using the &amp;lsquo;BatchExperiments&amp;rsquo; package [3] structure.
For each pair of {task, algorithm}, the bot will start N new jobs with random different hper-parameter settings. The budget N is defined as N = 100 * D , where D denotes the number of parameters in that algorithm&amp;rsquo;s space, and 100 is the tuning constant (defined empirically).</description>

      <description>Trelliscope is a visualization approach based on the idea of &amp;ldquo;small multiples&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Trellis Display&amp;rdquo;, where data are split into groups and a plot is made for each group, with the resulting plots arranged in a grid. This approach is very simple yet is considered to be &amp;ldquo;the best design solution for a wide range or problems in data presentation&amp;rdquo;. Trelliscope makes small multiple displays come alive by providing the ability to interactively sort and filter the plots based on summary statistics computed for each group.</description>

      <description>Data science and machine learning tools traditionally focus on training models. When companies begin to employ machine learning in actual production workflows, they encounter new sources of friction such as sharing models across teams, deploying identical models on different systems, and maintaining featurization logic. In this webinar, we discuss how Databricks provides a smooth path for productionizing Apache Spark MLlib models and featurization pipelines.
Databricks Model Scoring provides a simple API for exporting MLlib models and pipelines.</description>

      <description>Gradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by far the most common way to optimize neural networks. At the same time, every state-of-the-art Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient descent (e.g. lasagne&amp;rsquo;s, caffe&amp;rsquo;s, and keras&amp;rsquo; documentation). These algorithms, however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by.

      <description>Credit Risk Scoring is a classic yet still increasingly important operation in banking as banks continue to be increasingly risk careful when lending for mortgages or commercial purposes, in an industry known for fierce competition and the global financial crisis. With an accurate credit risk scoring model a bank is able to predict the likelihood of default on a transaction. This will in turn help evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt, as well as determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits, and even determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue through a variety of products.</description>

      <description>In part one of this series, I described the challenges of integrating the Akka Streams API with Akka Actors. I demonstrated the basic patterns for interfacing streams and actors, removing the discontinuity between the two. In this article, I will begin to explore more sophisticated ways to integrate actors and streams, in support of building robust and scalable distributed systems, rather than just simple applications, or stand-alone data-processing pipelines. This article will focus on how Akka Actors compliment the Akka Streams API with regard life-cycle management and fault tolerance.</description>

For most Machine Learning practitioners, mastering the art of tuning hyperparameters requires not only a solid background in Machine Learning algorithms, but also extensive experience working with real-world datasets.
In this post, I will give an overview of hyperparameters and various approaches of tuning hyperparameters intelligently. In particular, I will explain how we applied Bayesian Optimization to tune hyperparameters of a predictive model on a real-world dataset.</description>

In many applications of machine learning, users are asked to trust a model to help them make decisions. A doctor will certainly not operate on a patient simply because &amp;ldquo;the model said so.</description>

      <description>Bayesian Inference
Probabilistic programming enables us to construct and fit probabilistic models in code. At its essence, Bayesian inference is a principled way to draw conclusions from incomplete or imperfect data, by interpreting data in light of prior knowledge of probabilities. As pretty much all real-world data is incomplete or imperfect in some way, it&amp;rsquo;s an important (and old!) idea.
Bayesian inference might be the way to go if you:</description>

      <description>Akka Stream Concepts: Source ~&amp;gt; Flow ~&amp;gt; Sink (code example) Akka Stream is built with the decision to offer APIs that are minimal and consistent-as opposed to easy or intuitive. There is no magic, all the API features are explicit. You have operators to define Source, Sink, Flow, Graph and Operators. You have the operators to handle back-pressure, buffering, transformations, failure recovery, etc. But on my opinion the features that make Akka Stream implementation interesting are: 1.</description>

A while ago I worked on a project that used this tech stack
Akka HTTP : (actually we used Spray.IO but it is practically the same thing for the purpose of this article). For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know what Akka HTTP is, it is a simple Akka based framework that is also able to expose a REST interface to communicate with the actor system Cassandra database : Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.</description>

      <description>Abstract Learning algorithms related to artificial neural networks and in particular for Deep Learning may seem to involve many bells and whistles, called hyperparameters. This chapter is meant as a practical guide with recommendations for some of the most commonly used hyper-parameters, in particular in the context of learning algorithms based on backpropagated gradient and gradient-based optimization. It also discusses how to deal with the fact that more interesting results can be obtained when allowing one to adjust many hyper-parameters.</description>

      <description>THE USE CASE Let&amp;rsquo;s say that having a stream of elements of type E you want to observe their arbitrary property of type P, accumulate the elements as long as the property remains unchanged and only emit an immutable.Seq[E] of accumulated elements when the property changes. In a real-life example the elements can be e.g. lines in a CSV file which you would like to group by a given field.</description>

      <description>Machine learning is at the core of many recent advances in science and technology. With computers beating professionals in games like Go, many people have started asking if machines would also make for better drivers or even better doctors.
In many applications of machine learning, users are asked to trust a model to help them make decisions. A doctor will certainly not operate on a patient simply because &amp;quot;the model said so.</description>

      <description>In &amp;ldquo;Predictions 2016: The Mobile Revolution Accelerates&amp;rdquo;, Forrester forecasted that by the end of 2016 more than 25% of companies will consider mobile not as a channel, but as a fully integrated part of their overall strategy. Moreover, the research firm expects customer-focused companies to take personalization to the next level by extracting relevant moments from customer data using intelligent data processing techniques:
&amp;ldquo;To serve customers in context where they already are - not where brands find it convenient to serve them, firms must look to use context both to assemble and deliver experiences dynamically&amp;rdquo;</description>

Also, it&amp;rsquo;s much cheaper to make changes to sticky notes than production code. Learning about your systems by writing code is a very expensive way of understanding and refining the business processes involved. Nothing in this article requires technical expertise or previous experience with reactive, event-driven systems. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a business expert, developer, architect, product owner, or business owner, you should learn a few new techniques that will help you have more success and funcollaborating with your team and organization.</description>

      <description>Akka helps you build reliable applications which make use of multiple processor cores in one machine (&amp;ldquo;scaling up&amp;rdquo;) or distributed across a computer network (&amp;ldquo;scaling out&amp;rdquo;). The key abstraction to make this work is that all interactions between your code units-actors-happen via message passing, which is why the precise semantics of how messages are passed between actors deserve their own chapter.
In order to give some context to the discussion below, consider an application which spans multiple network hosts.</description>

      <description>In recent years, we have become increasingly good at training deep neural networks to learn a very accurate mapping from inputs to outputs, whether they are images, sentences, label predictions, etc. from large amounts of labeled data.
What our models still frightfully lack is the ability to generalize to conditions that are different from the ones encountered during training. When is this necessary? Every time you apply your model not to a carefully constructed dataset but to the real world.</description>

      <description>This article explores in more detail the idea of Meta Learning that was previously introduced in a post &amp;ldquo;The Meta Model and Meta Meta Model of Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;. In this post, I explore &amp;ldquo;Learning to Learn&amp;rdquo; as a Meta Learning approach. We have to be very careful to distinguish between Learning to Learn and Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO). HPO and more generally searching for architectures differs from &amp;ldquo;learning to learn&amp;rdquo; in that that HPO explores the space of architectures while meta-learning explores the space of learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>Historically hyperparameter determination has been a woefully forgotten aspect of machine learning. With the rise of neural nets - which require more hyperparameters, more precisely tuned than many other models - there has been a recent surge of interest in intelligent methods for selection; however, the average practitioner still seems to commonly use either default hyperparameters, grid search, random search, or (believe it or not) manual search.
For the readers who don&#39;t know, hyperparameter selection boils down to a conceptually simple problem: you have a set of variables (your hyperparameters) and an objective function (a measure of how good your model is).</description>

      <description>A popular method for exploring high-dimensional data is something called t-SNE, introduced by van der Maaten and Hinton in 2008 [1]. The technique has become widespread in the field of machine learning, since it has an almost magical ability to create compelling two-dimensonal &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo; from data with hundreds or even thousands of dimensions.

      <description>In addition to traditional statistical arrows like cluster analysis, principal components, and k-nearest neighbor, Indurkhya, in his course, also teaches non-standard methods.
One such method is based in information theory and relies on measures of data complexity. The idea is to isolate the records that add the most complexity to the data. An intuitive way to think about and measure this, without getting too deep into information theory, is to consider data compression algorithms.</description>

      <description>Abstract-In this paper, we develop the Data Science Machine, which is able to derive predictive models from raw data automatically. To achieve this automation, we first propose and develop the Deep Feature Synthesis algorithm for automatically generating features for relational datasets. The algorithm follows relationships in the data to a base field, and then sequentially applies mathematical functions along that path to create the final feature. Second, we implement a generalizable machine learning pipeline and tune it using a novel Gaussian Copula process based approach.</description>

Computers and mobiles have now become powerful enough to identify objects from images.
Not just images, they can chat with you as well! Haven&amp;rsquo;t you tried Google&amp;rsquo;s Allo app ? That&amp;rsquo;s not all-they can drive, make supersonic calculations, and help businesses solve the most complicated problems (more users, revenue, etc).</description>

      <description>TensorFlowT is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google&amp;rsquo;s Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.</description>

      <description>The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <description>WEKA is a widely used, open-source machine learning platform. Due to its intuitive interface, it is particularly popular with novice users. However, such users often find it hard to identify the best approach for their particular dataset among the many available. We describe the new version of Auto-WEKA, a system designed to help such users by automatically searching through the joint space of WEKA’s learning algorithms and their respective hyperparameter settings to maximize performance, using a state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization method.</description>

      <description>The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters.
Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods.</description>

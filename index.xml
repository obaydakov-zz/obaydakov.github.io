      <guid>https://obaydakov.github.io/post/2017/an-overview-of-gradient-descent-optimization-algorithms/</guid>
      <description>Gradient descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by far the most common way to optimize neural networks. At the same time, every state-of-the-art Deep Learning library contains implementations of various algorithms to optimize gradient descent (e.g. lasagne&amp;rsquo;s, caffe&amp;rsquo;s, and keras&amp;rsquo; documentation). These algorithms, however, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by.

      <description>Almost every machine learning algorithm comes with a large number of settings that we, the machine learning researchers and practitioners, need to specify. These tuning knobs, the so-called hyperparameters, help us control the behavior of machine learning algorithms when optimizing for performance, finding the right balance between bias and variance. Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization is an art in itself, and there are no hard-and-fast rules that guarantee best performance on a given dataset.</description>

      <description>Data scientists inhabit such an ever-changing landscape of languages, packages, and frameworks that it can be easy to succumb to tool fatigue. If this sounds familiar, you may have missed the increasing popularity of Linux containers in the DevOps world, in particular Docker. Michelangelo D&amp;rsquo;Agostino demonstrates Docker&amp;rsquo;s many benefits, from making data science code and environments more portable and shareable to making the transition from development to production more seamless to giving data scientists a common basis for collaborating with software engineers, and explains why Docker deserves a place in every data scientist&amp;rsquo;s toolkit.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;RandomBot&amp;rsquo; is a program that searches randomly the hyper-parameter space from different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, sampling different hyper-parameter settings via hyper-parameter sweep. It executes pre-defined &amp;lsquo;mlr&amp;rsquo; [1] learners over OpenML [2] classification problems using the &amp;lsquo;BatchExperiments&amp;rsquo; package [3] structure.
For each pair of {task, algorithm}, the bot will start N new jobs with random different hper-parameter settings. The budget N is defined as N = 100 * D , where D denotes the number of parameters in that algorithm&amp;rsquo;s space, and 100 is the tuning constant (defined empirically).</description>

      <description>Trelliscope is a visualization approach based on the idea of &amp;ldquo;small multiples&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Trellis Display&amp;rdquo;, where data are split into groups and a plot is made for each group, with the resulting plots arranged in a grid. This approach is very simple yet is considered to be &amp;ldquo;the best design solution for a wide range or problems in data presentation&amp;rdquo;. Trelliscope makes small multiple displays come alive by providing the ability to interactively sort and filter the plots based on summary statistics computed for each group.</description>

      <description>Data science and machine learning tools traditionally focus on training models. When companies begin to employ machine learning in actual production workflows, they encounter new sources of friction such as sharing models across teams, deploying identical models on different systems, and maintaining featurization logic. In this webinar, we discuss how Databricks provides a smooth path for productionizing Apache Spark MLlib models and featurization pipelines.
Databricks Model Scoring provides a simple API for exporting MLlib models and pipelines.</description>

      <description>Credit Risk Scoring is a classic yet still increasingly important operation in banking as banks continue to be increasingly risk careful when lending for mortgages or commercial purposes, in an industry known for fierce competition and the global financial crisis. With an accurate credit risk scoring model a bank is able to predict the likelihood of default on a transaction. This will in turn help evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to bad debt, as well as determine who qualifies for a loan, at what interest rate, and what credit limits, and even determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue through a variety of products.</description>

      <description>In part one of this series, I described the challenges of integrating the Akka Streams API with Akka Actors. I demonstrated the basic patterns for interfacing streams and actors, removing the discontinuity between the two. In this article, I will begin to explore more sophisticated ways to integrate actors and streams, in support of building robust and scalable distributed systems, rather than just simple applications, or stand-alone data-processing pipelines. This article will focus on how Akka Actors compliment the Akka Streams API with regard life-cycle management and fault tolerance.</description>

      <description>Hyperparameter tuning may be one of the most tricky, yet interesting, topics in Machine Learning. For most Machine Learning practitioners, mastering the art of tuning hyperparameters requires not only a solid background in Machine Learning algorithms, but also extensive experience working with real-world datasets.
In this post, I will give an overview of hyperparameters and various approaches of tuning hyperparameters intelligently. In particular, I will explain how we applied Bayesian Optimization to tune hyperparameters of a predictive model on a real-world dataset.</description>

      <description>Bayesian Inference
Probabilistic programming enables us to construct and fit probabilistic models in code. At its essence, Bayesian inference is a principled way to draw conclusions from incomplete or imperfect data, by interpreting data in light of prior knowledge of probabilities. As pretty much all real-world data is incomplete or imperfect in some way, it&amp;rsquo;s an important (and old!) idea.
Bayesian inference might be the way to go if you:</description>

      <description>Akka Stream Concepts: Source ~&amp;gt; Flow ~&amp;gt; Sink (code example) Akka Stream is built with the decision to offer APIs that are minimal and consistent-as opposed to easy or intuitive. There is no magic, all the API features are explicit. You have operators to define Source, Sink, Flow, Graph and Operators. You have the operators to handle back-pressure, buffering, transformations, failure recovery, etc. But on my opinion the features that make Akka Stream implementation interesting are: 1.</description>

A while ago I worked on a project that used this tech stack
Akka HTTP : (actually we used Spray.IO but it is practically the same thing for the purpose of this article). For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know what Akka HTTP is, it is a simple Akka based framework that is also able to expose a REST interface to communicate with the actor system Cassandra database : Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.</description>

      <description>Abstract Learning algorithms related to artificial neural networks and in particular for Deep Learning may seem to involve many bells and whistles, called hyperparameters. This chapter is meant as a practical guide with recommendations for some of the most commonly used hyper-parameters, in particular in the context of learning algorithms based on backpropagated gradient and gradient-based optimization. It also discusses how to deal with the fact that more interesting results can be obtained when allowing one to adjust many hyper-parameters.</description>

Nothing in this article requires technical expertise or previous experience with reactive, event-driven systems. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a business expert, developer, architect, product owner, or business owner, you should learn a few new techniques that will help you have more success and funcollaborating with your team and organization.</description>

      <description>Akka helps you build reliable applications which make use of multiple processor cores in one machine (&amp;ldquo;scaling up&amp;rdquo;) or distributed across a computer network (&amp;ldquo;scaling out&amp;rdquo;). The key abstraction to make this work is that all interactions between your code units-actors-happen via message passing, which is why the precise semantics of how messages are passed between actors deserve their own chapter.
In order to give some context to the discussion below, consider an application which spans multiple network hosts.</description>

      <description>This article provides a simple and intuitive derivation of the Kalman filter, with the aim of teaching this useful tool to students from disciplines that do not require a strong mathematical background. The most complicated level of mathematics required to understand this derivation is the ability to multiply two Gaussian functions together and reduce the result to a compact form. Link</description>

      <description>In recent years, we have become increasingly good at training deep neural networks to learn a very accurate mapping from inputs to outputs, whether they are images, sentences, label predictions, etc. from large amounts of labeled data.
What our models still frightfully lack is the ability to generalize to conditions that are different from the ones encountered during training. When is this necessary? Every time you apply your model not to a carefully constructed dataset but to the real world.</description>

      <description>This article explores in more detail the idea of Meta Learning that was previously introduced in a post &amp;ldquo;The Meta Model and Meta Meta Model of Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;. In this post, I explore &amp;ldquo;Learning to Learn&amp;rdquo; as a Meta Learning approach. We have to be very careful to distinguish between Learning to Learn and Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO). HPO and more generally searching for architectures differs from &amp;ldquo;learning to learn&amp;rdquo; in that that HPO explores the space of architectures while meta-learning explores the space of learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>Historically hyperparameter determination has been a woefully forgotten aspect of machine learning. With the rise of neural nets - which require more hyperparameters, more precisely tuned than many other models - there has been a recent surge of interest in intelligent methods for selection; however, the average practitioner still seems to commonly use either default hyperparameters, grid search, random search, or (believe it or not) manual search.
For the readers who don&#39;t know, hyperparameter selection boils down to a conceptually simple problem: you have a set of variables (your hyperparameters) and an objective function (a measure of how good your model is).</description>

      <description>A popular method for exploring high-dimensional data is something called t-SNE, introduced by van der Maaten and Hinton in 2008 [1]. The technique has become widespread in the field of machine learning, since it has an almost magical ability to create compelling two-dimensonal &amp;ldquo;maps&amp;rdquo; from data with hundreds or even thousands of dimensions.

      <description>The age of data is here. Sensors, cameras, security monitoring systems, software, hardware, the internet, and even humans themselves all have one thing in common: data. And as data becomes ubiquitous, in parallel, business interest in using and learning from that data is on the rise. Enter big data, a holistic term that aims to encapsulate the sheer massiveness of the amount of information available from the growing number of data sources.</description>

      <description>In addition to traditional statistical arrows like cluster analysis, principal components, and k-nearest neighbor, Indurkhya, in his course, also teaches non-standard methods.
One such method is based in information theory and relies on measures of data complexity. The idea is to isolate the records that add the most complexity to the data. An intuitive way to think about and measure this, without getting too deep into information theory, is to consider data compression algorithms.</description>

      <description>Abstract-In this paper, we develop the Data Science Machine, which is able to derive predictive models from raw data automatically. To achieve this automation, we first propose and develop the Deep Feature Synthesis algorithm for automatically generating features for relational datasets. The algorithm follows relationships in the data to a base field, and then sequentially applies mathematical functions along that path to create the final feature. Second, we implement a generalizable machine learning pipeline and tune it using a novel Gaussian Copula process based approach.</description>

      <description>Introduction Deep Learning isn&amp;rsquo;t a recent discovery. The seeds were sown back in the 1950s when the first artificial neural network was created. Since then, progress has been rapid, with the structure of the neuron being &amp;ldquo;re-invented&amp;rdquo; artificially.
Computers and mobiles have now become powerful enough to identify objects from images.
Not just images, they can chat with you as well! Haven&amp;rsquo;t you tried Google&amp;rsquo;s Allo app ? That&amp;rsquo;s not all-they can drive, make supersonic calculations, and help businesses solve the most complicated problems (more users, revenue, etc).</description>

      <description>TensorFlowT is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google&amp;rsquo;s Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.</description>

      <description>The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <description>WEKA is a widely used, open-source machine learning platform. Due to its intuitive interface, it is particularly popular with novice users. However, such users often find it hard to identify the best approach for their particular dataset among the many available. We describe the new version of Auto-WEKA, a system designed to help such users by automatically searching through the joint space of WEKA’s learning algorithms and their respective hyperparameter settings to maximize performance, using a state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization method.</description>

      <description>The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters.
Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods.</description>
